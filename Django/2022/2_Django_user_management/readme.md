Read this before you start coding and exploring the code.

This is code from the RealPython website, here is the link for the

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you have to install all requirements. Installation process on Linux/macOS and Windows:

cd Django_user_management
```

__2. Clone repository by typing:__

```
git clone https://github.com/Szymon-Budziak/CodeBrainers.git
```

__3. Enter `CodeBrainers/Django/2_Django_user_management/` folder:__

```

- Linux/macOS machine:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

(if python is not working try using python3)
